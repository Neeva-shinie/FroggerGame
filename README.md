## Overview
As a part of my university assignment, I was asked to create a Frogger Game from scratch using the same functionalities as the actual game.
This project was done entirely in TypeScript with some HTML and CSS.

## User Interface


## Running code

There are two ways to run the code:

1. Build the code and then open the web page

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run build`
- Open the html file dist/index.html (NOT src/index.html)
